          <p>
            This project utilizes the canvas drawing API for javascript as well as 
            <a href="http://www.algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf">this</a> concept of algorythmic botany to create 
            flowers using the golden ratio. I added my own twist by adding customization for the starting divergence and padding 
            as well as a rate of change for both that can be manipulated to make interesting creations. This project also uses 
            local storage to save settings and highscores, the bulma css library, custom web components (the navbar, the header, 
            and the footer), and importing data and functions from other pages to allow for ease of programming across multiple 
            pages (such as using the same functions in free play and challenge).

          <p>
            I met most requierments for this project.
            <ol>
              <li>I have 4 distinct pages (with freeplay and challenge effectively both acting as app pages)</li>
              <li>My files are organized into different folders (including the requiered src and style)</li>
              <li>I have a navbar that updates to which page you are on</li>
              <li>I use bulma css for all pages</li>
              <li>I follow a minimalistic black and white with spots of color for the rainbow flowers for all pages of the site</li>
              <li>All the controls and buttons have title attributes that help describe their functionality</li>
              <li>While the exact wording may be unconventional at first, each control has a title to explain what it does and 
                the user can easily see the effect of their changes</li>
              <li>There are no errors in the code</li>
              <li>Drawing again clears the canvas and does not break anything</li>
              <li>Home page tells the user what the app does</li>
              <li>The pinwheel font awesome I chose resembles a flower amd acts as a brand</li>
              <li>Documentation page has all requiered content</li>
              <li>I combined algorithmic botany with a game in the challenge mode</li>
              <li>I have plenty more than 3 widgits for the user to interact</li>
              <li>All code is neatly implimented</li>
              <li>I have 3 web components that I use (header, navbar, and footer)</li>
              <li>I draw directly using CanvasRenderingContext2D</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            I also went above and beyond in this project by going well beyond what we covered in class with algorythmic botany by 
            including so many different controls, including a random setting button, and adding a challenge mode that calculates 
            how close a guess was and how many points thats worth as well as code that keeps track of the user's high score.

        <!-- ToDo -->
        <div class="box has-background-dark has-text-light mt-2">
          <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold has-text-light mb-1">ToDo</h2>
          <p>
            If I had extra time then I would've liked to include a community tab that could share 2 things. First I would want to 
            have a global leaderboard for the high scores of everyone in challenge mode. It also would've been nice to be able to 
            save different flower setting combinations and share them with different names to the cloud and maybe vote on other 
            ones you liked, but that would require adding an interface and a way to load premade flowers which wouldve taken more 
            time than I had. Also if I had more time, I would've wanted to add extra difficulties to challenge mode such as it 
            unlocking more and more settings (rather than only guessing 1, you would need to guess 2 or 3 or 4).
